# Praxisprojekt1

in this repo we maintain our code-basis and store plots 

### Set-Up
if you want to take a closer view on the code produced using your IDE, we highly recommend you to complete the following steps:
* on your C:-Drive create a directory "Entwicklung"
* clone the repo it the newly created directory, using
  * "cd C:/Entwicklung"
  * "git clone https://github.com/JanisEcker/Praxisprojekt1.git"
* last step to complete: taking care of the data foundation
  * in the cloned project, create a folder called "Data"
  * either download the files as being stored in the "Uni Ulm Cloudstore", find the links below and place them in the directory "data"
  * you are good to go and everything should work
* if you do not want to download the data:
  * run cell 1 ("imports")   
  * change the paths in the 2nd cell to the "alternative" and hide the current, default ones
  * run the 2nd cell
  * be aware that this might take some time and requires lots of RAM-Storage
